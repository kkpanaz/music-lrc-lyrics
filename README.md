# Music LRC Lyrics
Get lyrics for all your faviourite songs in LRC format using a range of backends (A.K.A. websites).

Also includes fallback integrations to get lyrics without timestamps (if lyrics with timestamps can't be found). These will be stored in TXT format (not LRC).

## Backends Supported
- [Megalobiz](https://www.megalobiz.com/)
- [RCLyricsBand](https://rclyricsband.com/)

## Fallback Backends (no timestamps)
- [Genius](https://genius.com/)

## How To Use
1. Create an input file containing one line per song in the format `<artist>|<title>|<duration>` where:
    - `|` can be replaced by input separator argument
    - `duration` should be in the format `<hours>:<minutes>:<seconds>` where each is a 2 digit integer
    - I suggest using a tool like [Spotlistr](https://www.spotlistr.com/export/spotify-playlist)
2. Pip install requirements.txt
3. Run `main.py` specifying input and output (uses sample by default)
    ```
    Î» py main.py -h
